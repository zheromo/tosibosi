XWiki
===
First generation wikis are used to collaborate on content. Second generation wikis (a.k.a Structured and Applications Wikis) can be used to create collaborative web applications (by using the wiki paradigm and editing wiki pages). XWiki can be used either as a first generation wiki or a second generation one.
